# LSTM for Deep Knowledge tracing written in PyTorch and TensorFlow

The main files are pyTorch.py and tensorflow.py which are used for the network training.



The folders cointains following:

analysis -> results from data analysis on the datasets slepemapy.cz

baselines -> code for running baseline methods on the datasets

data -> data containing answers from slepemapy, and codes for the same
datasets parser for further purposes

datasets -> parsed data which can be fed to the neural network

generators -> scripts for generating data

maps -> evaluation on map and helper for creating data for the map

parsers -> parsers for the dataset 

plots -> graphs from evaluation

relationship_discovery_data-> data for relationship discovery obtained from neural network
