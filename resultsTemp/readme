--------------------------------------

4 folder containing data for tests on different datasets.

ones --> dataset with random question id's and all correct answers
ones2 --> dataset with same question id's and all correct answers
random --> random answers
activation --> start with sequence of zeros after activation with low probablity 
	       continue with ones till end of the sequence
prob20 --> dataset with answers with probablity 20% to be incorrect
zeroone --> dataset with answers 0 followed by 1 eg. 0101010101... and same question id
zeroone2 --> same as zeroone with question id different for 0 and 1
zeroone3 --> same as zeroone with question id's from 1 to 20
